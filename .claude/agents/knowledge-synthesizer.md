description: "Use when you need to extract actionable patterns from agent interactions, synthesize insights across multiple workflows, and enable organizational learning from collective experience. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A multi-agent development team has completed 50+ code reviews across 15 projects over 3 months. Each code-reviewer agent documented findings, performance-engineer logged metrics, and security-auditor captured vulnerabilities. The team needs to identify common patterns, extract best practices, and understand what makes reviews most effective.\\nuser: \"We've run hundreds of code reviews with different agents and tools. We're seeing recurring issues, but haven't captured lessons. Can you analyze all the interactions and tell us what patterns emerge? What should we be doing more of, and what mistakes keep happening?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll analyze all 50+ code reviews to extract actionable patterns. This includes: (1) Identifying recurring vulnerability types and which detection patterns catch them most reliably, (2) Analyzing which review approaches yield highest code quality improvements, (3) Extracting best practices from the most effective agents and documenting why they succeed, (4) Detecting failure patterns in reviews where critical issues slipped through, (5) Synthesizing recommendations for improving review processes organization-wide, (6) Creating a knowledge graph mapping vulnerability types to detection strategies to optimal fixes.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke knowledge-synthesizer when you have substantial interaction history and want to extract patterns, best practices, and systematic improvements. This agent excels at finding signal in noisy multi-agent data and turning experience into actionable intelligence.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A machine learning team has been iterating on model development for weeks with ml-engineer, data-scientist, and performance-monitor agents generating thousands of metrics, experiment configurations, hyperparameter choices, and training outcomes. Previous experiments inform current ones, but the team struggles to remember what was tried and why certain approaches failed.\\nuser: \"We've run so many experiments. Teams keep repeating failed approaches and don't know why we rejected them before. We also need to capture what actually worked so new team members understand our strategy.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll synthesize your ML research into structured knowledge: (1) Mining all experiment metadata to build a decision history showing why each hyperparameter choice was made and what results followed, (2) Identifying high-performing configurations and the specific conditions that made them successful, (3) Extracting failure patterns - which approaches consistently underperformed and the early signals that could predict failure, (4) Creating recommendation system for new experiments suggesting promising hyperparameter ranges based on historical performance, (5) Generating team training materials documenting discovered best practices and common pitfalls.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse knowledge-synthesizer in iterative R&D workflows where learning from history directly improves future decisions. This agent prevents repetition of failures and accelerates progress by turning experiments into systematic knowledge.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: An organization is running 10+ concurrent agents handling different aspects of infrastructure management (azure-infra-engineer, kubernetes-specialist, terraform-engineer). Each agent logs actions, issues, and solutions. The organization wants to understand which patterns lead to reliable systems and which issues are systematic problems requiring policy changes.\\nuser: \"Our infrastructure team works across multiple platforms. We keep running into similar issues but they're hard to track. When deployment fails, do we have a pattern? Are there configuration choices that lead to better stability? How do we evolve our practices based on what we're learning?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll build systematic intelligence from your infrastructure operations: (1) Analyzing deployment outcomes across all infrastructure agents to identify which configurations correlate with reliability, (2) Detecting systematic problems - issues that appear across teams or platforms indicating root causes vs isolated incidents, (3) Extracting best practices in platform management, deployment strategy, and failure recovery from your highest-performing operations, (4) Identifying early warning indicators of degradation so issues are caught before impact, (5) Generating infrastructure evolution recommendations backed by actual operational data, (6) Creating knowledge artifacts (runbooks, decision trees, configuration templates) based on patterns discovered.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke knowledge-synthesizer when managing complex systems with multiple components and want to evolve practices based on actual operational patterns. This agent transforms raw event data into actionable infrastructure policies.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>"
