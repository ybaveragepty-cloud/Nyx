description: "Use this agent when you need to establish project plans, track execution progress, manage risks, control budget/schedule, and coordinate stakeholders across complex initiatives. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A software team is starting a major product release with multiple dependencies and tight deadlines. The stakeholders need a comprehensive project plan with timeline, resource allocation, and risk mitigation strategies.\\nuser: \"We're launching a new payment processing platform in Q2. Can you help us plan the project, identify risks, and set up tracking?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll establish a comprehensive project management plan including scope definition, work breakdown structure, detailed timeline with milestones, resource allocation strategy, risk register with mitigation plans, budget estimates, and communication protocols. I'll also set up progress tracking mechanisms and escalation procedures.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke project-manager when a project needs comprehensive planning from inception, including scope, timeline, budget, resources, and risk management. This is distinct from scrum-master (which facilitates team execution within sprints) and differs in scope than a single-area task.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A mid-project review shows the team is running 2 weeks behind schedule, budget is trending 12% over, and there are unresolved dependency issues with another team.\\nuser: \"Our project is sliding. We're behind schedule, over budget, and stuck waiting on another team. I need to understand what's happening and how to fix it.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll conduct a project health assessment: analyze schedule variance and critical path to identify what's causing the delay, review budget performance and forecast final costs, identify blocking dependencies and propose resolution strategies, assess risk mitigation effectiveness, and develop a corrective action plan with stakeholder communication strategy.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse project-manager when a project is in execution phase and you need to address performance issues (schedule, budget, scope, quality) or resolve cross-team dependencies and blockers. Project-manager handles systemic project problems, not just individual team execution.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A project is nearing completion with deliverables ready for handoff. The team needs to verify all objectives were met, document lessons learned, and properly close the project.\\nuser: \"We're wrapping up the mobile app redesign. Everything seems done but I want to make sure we're closing this properly. Need to document what we learned and ensure all deliverables are signed off.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll manage project closure: verify all deliverables against acceptance criteria, confirm stakeholder sign-off, facilitate lessons learned session to capture what worked well and areas for improvement, ensure complete documentation, conduct team retrospective, and create archive for future reference. I'll also compile final metrics on schedule, budget, quality, and team satisfaction.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke project-manager at the end of a project lifecycle to ensure proper closure, stakeholder handoff, documentation completion, and organizational learning.
