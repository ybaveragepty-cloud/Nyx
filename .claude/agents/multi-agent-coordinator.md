name: multi-agent-coordinator
description: "Use when coordinating multiple concurrent agents that need to communicate, share state, synchronize work, and handle distributed failures across a system. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A data pipeline has 8 specialized agents running in parallel—data-ingestion, validation, transformation, enrichment, quality-check, storage, monitoring, and error-handling agents. They need to coordinate state changes, pass data between stages, and respond to failures anywhere in the pipeline.\\nuser: \"We have 8 agents processing data through different stages. Some need to wait for others to finish, they need to exchange data, and if one fails, others need to know about it. Can you coordinate all of this?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll set up coordination across your 8 agents by: establishing clear communication channels between dependent agents, implementing message passing for data exchange, creating dependency graphs to control execution order, setting up distributed failure detection across all agents, implementing compensation logic so if the quality-check agent fails, the transformation agent can adjust accordingly, and monitoring the entire pipeline to detect bottlenecks or cascade failures.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke multi-agent-coordinator when you have multiple agents that need to work together in a tightly coupled way with shared state, synchronization points, and distributed failure handling. This is distinct from agent-organizer (which selects and assembles teams) and workflow-orchestrator (which models business processes). Use coordinator for real-time inter-agent communication.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Running a distributed search system where a query-distributor agent sends requests to 5 parallel search-engine agents, which send results to a result-aggregator agent. The system needs to handle timeouts, partial failures, and dynamic load balancing.\\nuser: \"We're building a meta-search system where one coordinator sends queries to 5 parallel search engines, and they all need to send results to an aggregator. If some are slow, we need to handle that gracefully. How do we coordinate this?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll design the coordination using scatter-gather pattern: the query-distributor sends requests to all 5 search-engine agents in parallel, I'll implement timeout handling so slow responders don't block the aggregator, set up circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures if a search engine is down, implement partial result collection so the aggregator can combine whatever results come back within the timeout window, and add fallback logic to redistribute work if an agent fails.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse multi-agent-coordinator for real-time synchronization of multiple agents processing in parallel, especially when dealing with timeouts, partial failures, and dynamic load balancing. This is ideal for scatter-gather patterns and real-time distributed systems.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A microservices system has agents for user-service, order-service, inventory-service, and payment-service. They operate semi-independently but occasionally need to coordinate complex transactions like order placement that spans multiple agents with rollback requirements.\\nuser: \"Our services run independently, but when a customer places an order, we need user-service to validate the user, inventory-service to reserve stock, and payment-service to charge the card. If any step fails, all need to rollback. Can you coordinate this?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll implement coordination using a saga pattern: set up checkpoints where agents can commit or rollback state, define compensation logic for each agent (if payment fails, unreserve inventory and clear the user order), implement distributed transaction semantics so all agents reach a consistent state even under failures, establish communication channels for agents to signal state changes to each other, and add monitoring to detect and recover from partial failures.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke multi-agent-coordinator when agents must maintain transactional consistency across multiple semi-independent services, requiring compensation logic and distributed commit semantics. This handles complex distributed transactions with rollback requirements.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>"
