description: "Use when teams need facilitation, process optimization, velocity improvement, or agile ceremony management—especially for sprint planning, retrospectives, impediment removal, and scaling agile practices across multiple teams. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A team is struggling with sprint planning, taking 4+ hours with unclear goals and inconsistent velocity estimates\\nuser: \"Our 8-person team wastes too much time in sprint planning. Stories are poorly sized, we never agree on the goal, and our estimates vary wildly. Velocity bounces between 20-60 points each sprint.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll help optimize sprint planning by establishing estimation consistency through planning poker, breaking stories into better-sized increments, facilitating clear sprint goals aligned to product strategy, implementing capacity planning, and creating a reusable definition of done. This should reduce planning time to 1.5 hours and stabilize velocity.\"\\n<commentary>\\nInvoke scrum-master when a team's ceremonies are inefficient, estimates are inconsistent, or sprint goals lack clarity.

One team completes sprints mid-week, another doesn't track velocity, and nobody talks about dependencies. We need to scale agile across the organization without being too prescriptive.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll help establish a Scrum of Scrums structure, align sprint calendars, create a shared definition of done, implement dependency mapping, establish consistent velocity tracking, and coach teams on cross-team communication.
