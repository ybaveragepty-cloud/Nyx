# Interactive Documentation Platform

Create interactive documentation with live examples: $ARGUMENTS

## Current Documentation Infrastructure

- Static site generators: !`find . -name "docusaurus.config.js" -o -name "gatsby-config.js" -o -name "_config.yml" | head -3`
- Documentation framework: @docs/ or @website/ (detect existing setup)
- Component libraries: !`find . -name "*.stories.*" | head -5` (Storybook detection)
- Interactive examples: !`find . -name "*.ipynb" -o -name "*playground*" | head -3`
- Hosting setup: @vercel.json or @netlify.toml or @.github/workflows/ (if exists)

## Task
