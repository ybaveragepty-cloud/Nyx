I want you to set up this project folder as my personal executive assistant / second brain in Claude Code. You're going to do this in 3 phases. Complete each phase fully before moving to the next.


## Phase 1: Create the folder structure


First, initialize a git repo in this folder if one doesn't exist already.


Then create the following template structure. Don't put any content in the files yet -- just create the skeleton with placeholder files where noted.


```
CLAUDE.md                           # Main brain file (we'll fill this in Phase 3)
CLAUDE.local.md                     # My personal overrides (git-ignored)
.gitignore                          # Ignore .env, CLAUDE.local.md, settings.local.json
.claude/
  settings.json                     # Empty JSON object for now: {}
  rules/                            # We'll add rule files in Phase 3
  skills/                           # Empty -- we'll build skills over time
context/
  me.md                             # About me (filled in Phase 3)
  work.md                           # My business/work details (filled in Phase 3)
  team.md                           # My team (filled in Phase 3)
  current-priorities.md             # What I'm focused on right now (filled in Phase 3)
  goals.md                          # Quarterly goals and milestones (filled in Phase 3)
templates/
  session-summary.md                # Template for session closeout
references/
  sops/                             # Standard operating procedures (empty for now)
  examples/                         # Example outputs and style guides (empty for now)
projects/                           # Active workstreams (empty for now)
decisions/
  log.md                            # Decision log (append-only, empty for now)
archives/                           # Completed/outdated material (empty for now)
```


For empty directories, create a `.gitkeep` file inside them so git tracks them.


For `templates/session-summary.md`, use this starter template:


```markdown
# Session Summary


**Date:**
**Focus:**


## What Got Done
-


## Decisions Made
-


## Open Items / Next Steps
-


## Memory Updates
- Preferences learned:
- Decisions to log:
```


For `decisions/log.md`, use this starter:


```markdown
# Decision Log


Append-only. When a meaningful decision is made, log it here.


Format: [YYYY-MM-DD] DECISION: ... | REASONING: ... | CONTEXT: ...


---
```


For `.gitignore`:


```
.env
CLAUDE.local.md
.claude/settings.local.json
node_modules/
```


For `CLAUDE.local.md`:


```markdown
# Local Overrides


Personal preferences and overrides that don't get shared via git.
Add anything here that's specific to your local setup.
```


## Phase 2: Ask me onboarding questions


Before filling in the context files, rules, and CLAUDE.md, interview me. Ask these questions one section at a time. Don't dump all questions at once -- go section by section and wait for my answers before moving on.


### Section 1: About You
- What's your name?
- What's your role/title? (e.g., CEO, freelancer, content creator, developer)
- What's your timezone?
- In one sentence, what do you do?
- What's your #1 priority -- the thing everything else should support?


### Section 2: Your Business / Work
- What's your company or business called? (or describe your work if you're not a business owner)
- What are your products, services, or revenue streams? (List each with a one-liner)
- Roughly how much revenue does each generate? (optional, but helps me prioritize)
- What tools do you use day-to-day? (ClickUp, Notion, Slack, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Do you have any MCP servers already connected to Claude Code? (If you don't know what this means, just say no)


### Section 3: Your Team
- Do you have a team? If yes, how many people?
- Who are the 2-3 key people I should know about? (name, role, when to loop them in)
- Where does your team communicate? (ClickUp, Slack, etc.)
- What's your biggest pain point with managing your team?


### Section 4: Priorities, Goals & Projects
- What are the 3-5 things you're most focused on right now?
- Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive items I should know about?
- Do you have quarterly goals or milestones you're tracking? (If yes, list them. If you don't do formal goals, that's fine -- your priorities above will work.)
- What active projects or workstreams are you managing right now? (These are specific initiatives, not ongoing responsibilities. E.g., "launching a new course", "hiring a VA", "redesigning the website")


### Section 5: Communication Preferences
- How do you like information presented? (bullet points, detailed paragraphs, etc.)
- Any writing pet peeves? (e.g., "never use emojis", "no em dashes", "keep it under 3 sentences")
- What tone do you want internally (casual, professional, etc.)?
- What tone do you want for external/public-facing content?


### Section 6: What Do You Want Help With?
- What are the recurring tasks that eat up your time? (List as many as you want)
- What would you hand off to an assistant first if you could?
- Are there any specific workflows you want to automate or templatize?


## Phase 3: Build out the files


Based on my answers, fill in all the files:


### Context files
- **context/me.md** -- My profile based on Section 1 answers
- **context/work.md** -- My business/work details based on Section 2 answers
- **context/team.md** -- Team structure based on Section 3 answers (if I have a team; if solo, note that and skip this file)
- **context/current-priorities.md** -- Priorities from Section 4, dated today
- **context/goals.md** -- Quarterly goals and milestones from Section 4. If no formal goals, use their top priorities as informal goals. Date it with the current quarter (e.g., "Q2 2026"). Include a note at the top: "Update this file at the start of each quarter."


### Projects
If the user listed active projects in Section 4, create a folder for each inside `projects/`. Each project folder gets a brief `README.md` with:
- One-line description of the project
- Current status (active, planning, on hold)
- Key dates or deadlines mentioned


If no specific projects were mentioned, leave `projects/` empty.


### Rule files in .claude/rules/
Create rule files based on my communication preferences (Section 5). Suggested files:
- **communication-style.md** -- Writing tone, formatting preferences, pet peeves
- Any other domain-specific rules that emerged from my answers (e.g., if I mentioned specific tool conventions, content guidelines, etc.)


Keep each rule file focused on ONE topic. Don't create more than 3-4 rule files to start.


### CLAUDE.md (the main brain file)
This is the most important file. Keep it UNDER 150 lines. It should contain:


1. **One-line identity** -- Who you are to me (e.g., "You are [Name]'s executive assistant.")
2. **Top priority** -- The #1 thing everything supports
3. **Context imports** -- Use `@context/me.md`, `@context/team.md`, `@context/goals.md`, etc. to reference files instead of repeating their content
4. **Tool integrations** -- What tools are connected (ClickUp, etc.)
5. **Skills directory** -- Point to `.claude/skills/` and explain how skills work
6. **Decision log** -- Point to `decisions/log.md` and explain append-only convention
7. **Memory** -- Add a section explaining how memory works:
   - "Claude Code maintains a persistent memory across conversations. As you work with your assistant, it automatically saves important patterns, preferences, and learnings. You don't need to configure this -- it works out of the box."
   - "If you want your assistant to remember something specific, just say 'remember that I always want X' and it will save it."
   - "Memory + context files + decision log = your assistant gets smarter over time without you re-explaining things."
8. **Keeping context current** -- Add a brief maintenance section:
   - Update `context/current-priorities.md` when your focus shifts
   - Update `context/goals.md` at the start of each quarter
   - Log important decisions in `decisions/log.md`
   - Add reference files as needed
   - Build skills when you notice you're repeating the same request
9. **Projects** -- Point to `projects/` and explain that active workstreams live there
10. **Templates** -- Point to `templates/`
11. **References** -- Point to `references/`
12. **Archives rule** -- Don't delete, archive


Do NOT put communication style rules in CLAUDE.md -- those go in `.claude/rules/communication-style.md`.


Do NOT repeat context from the context files -- just import them with @.


Do NOT include a "Session Start Protocol" that tells Claude to read a bunch of files -- the import system and rules handle that automatically now.


### Skills directory
Leave `.claude/skills/` empty. Don't create any skills yet. Just make sure CLAUDE.md mentions that skills live there and explains the pattern:
- Each skill gets a folder: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Skills are built organically as recurring workflows emerge
- Include a note about the answers from Section 6 (what they want help with) as a "Skills to Build" backlog in CLAUDE.md or a separate file


## Final Step


After everything is created:
1. Show me a tree view of every file and folder you created
2. Show me a brief summary of what's in each file (one line per file)
3. List the "Skills to Build" backlog based on my Section 6 answers -- these are the workflows we'll turn into skills over time
4. Show me this maintenance cheat sheet:


**Keeping Your Assistant Sharp**
- **Weekly:** Nothing required. Auto-memory handles daily learnings for you.
- **Monthly:** Glance at `context/current-priorities.md`. If your focus has shifted, update it.
- **Quarterly:** Update `context/goals.md` with new goals and milestones.
- **As needed:** Log decisions in `decisions/log.md`. Add reference files. Build new skills.
- **Pro tip:** If you want your assistant to remember something permanently, just tell it: "Remember that I always prefer X." It will save it across all future conversations.


5. Create the first git commit with all the files
6. Ask me if I want to build any of those skills right now


## Important Rules for You (Claude)


- Do NOT create any skills yet. The skills directory should be empty after setup.
- Keep CLAUDE.md UNDER 150 lines. If it's getting long, you're putting too much in it.
- Use @ imports (e.g., @context/me.md) in CLAUDE.md instead of repeating information.
- One rule file = one topic. Max 3-4 rule files to start.
- Ask onboarding questions ONE SECTION AT A TIME. Wait for my response before asking the next section.
- If I say "skip" or "I'll fill that in later" for any section, create the file with a placeholder and move on.
